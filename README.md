# goat-and-box
This is a project I made to explore how to use 3d models in three js and interact with them. I learned three js from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oFvqLfRnsU&ab_channel=DesignCourse).

The goat model I used is based on "Goat" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/goat-a1008ad98bdf420e80d46c29af1928c4) by sambasivarao (https://sketchfab.com/sambasivarao) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
